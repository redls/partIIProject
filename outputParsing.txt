1 `` Extreme Ops '' exceeds expectations .
1 Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
2 A thunderous ride 's at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action .
2 Still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .
3 This movie was great .
