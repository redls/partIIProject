A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 5742
Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . 5743
Almost . 5744
... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 5745
The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . 5746
Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 5747
The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge . 5748
Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end . 5749
The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 5750
Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 5751
Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it 's looking for . 5752
Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it . 5753
... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer -LRB- and -RRB- the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . 5754
In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried . 5755
Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . '' 5756

Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time 5758
The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 5759
So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 5760
I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 5761
If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 5762

There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening . 5764
`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker . 5765
A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 5766
Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny . 5767
The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers . 5768
Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 5769
Sitting through the last reel -LRB- spoiler alert ! -RRB- 5770
is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House . 5771
Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 5772
Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 5773
With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 5774
One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off 5775
A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 5776
Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . 5777
But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti 5778
The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 5779
A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 5780
The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 5781
Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD . 5782
Feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 5783
Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . 5784
Can you bear the laughter ? 5785
Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit 5786
There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 5787

They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 5789
Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 5790
The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 5791
Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 5792

There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 5797
Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 5798
It 's all pretty tame . 5799
The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 5800
The movie is a mess from start to finish . 5801
The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 5802
I 'm not saying that Ice Age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 5803
In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 5804
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichÃ©s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 5805
Terminally brain dead production . 5806
Some episodes work , some do n't . 5807
Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 5808
J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl . 5809
Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 5810
Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were . 5811
Wow . 5812
I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 5813
Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all . 5814
It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 5815
Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence . 5816

Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 5818
The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . 5819
The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 5820
There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever . 5821
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 5822
A processed comedy chop suey . 5823
As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink . 5824
Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix . 5825
Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 5826
An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 5827
The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 5828

A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff . 5833
The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything . 5834
It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 5835
The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 5836
So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . 5837
It never is , not fully . 5838
Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 5839
What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 5840
As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 5841
Plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 5842
The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 5843
Oozes condescension from every pore . 5844
`` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 5845
The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 5846
Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 5847
It has plenty of laughs . 5848
It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense . 5849
An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 5850
Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 5851
-LRB- H -RRB- ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by . 5852
Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 5853
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding 5854
By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 5855
Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 5856
Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 5857
At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart . 5858
At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford . 5859
Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos . 5860
This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 5861
With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low . 5862
Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 5863
You might be shocked to discover that Seinfeld 's real life is boring . 5864
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 5865
Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 5866

... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that wo n't win many fans over the age of 12 . 5877
Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 5878
Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 5879
The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch . 5880
A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 5881
It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 5882
An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 5883
It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too . 5884
Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 5885
Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 5886
If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . 5887
An EXIT sign , that is . 5888

The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 5890

Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 5893
Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 5894
There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening . 5895

The result might look like Vulgar . 5897
Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands . 5898
What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky . 5899
It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long . 5900
The film favors the scientific over the spectacular -LRB- visually speaking -RRB- . 5901
Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 5902
With the exception of McCoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park . 5903
The acting is n't much better . 5904
The whole affair is as predictable as can be . 5905
A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes . 5906
This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 5907
A suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 5908
Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 5909
-LRB- N -RRB- o matter how much good will the actors generate , Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 5910

Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless . 5913

Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 5915
Gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful clichÃ© in the book at this nonsensical story . 5916
A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 5917
-LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting . 5918
The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 5919
` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . 5920
You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... ' 5921
Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 5922
Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core . 5923
The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . 5924
The results are far more alienating than involving . 5925
Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 5926

The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland . 5935
The film can depress you about life itself . 5936
I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clichÃ© . 5937
The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line . 5938

Here 's my advice , Kev . 5943
Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 5944
An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets . 5945
An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 5946
Unfortunately , it 's also not very good . 5947
Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 5948
It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 5949
Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum . 5950
This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 5951
It winds up moving in many directions as it searches -LRB- vainly , I think -RRB- for something fresh to say . 5952
All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 5953
A big fat pain . 5954
A mimetic approximation of better films like Contempt and 8Â 1\/2 . 5955
Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 5956
Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures . 5957
An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 5958
To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 5959
With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 5960
Mild , meandering teen flick . 5961
Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 5962
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before . 5963
Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League . 5964
Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . 5965
Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild . 5966
One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou . 5967
With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 5968
To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough . 5969
Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 5970

Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting . 5972
-LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 5973
This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero . 5974
Silly , loud and goofy . 5975
Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 5976
The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 5977
The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 5978
The Pool drowned me in boredom . 5979
It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism . 5980
It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 5981
Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 5982
There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 5983
As saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 5984
Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 5985
As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 5986
The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 5987
It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this ! 5988
This is an interesting movie ! '' 5989
But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 5990
The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid . 5991
It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 5992
Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book . 5993
A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 5994
While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 5995
Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` Saving Private Ryan '' battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time ? 5996
It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 5997
... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts . 5998
This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter . 5999
Why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free ? 6000
There 's no good answer to that one . 6001
This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 6002
A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms . 6003
There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 6004
This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 6005
This is amusing for about three minutes . 6006
Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 6007
It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' . 6008

Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 6285
An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 6286
Woody Allen has really found his groove these days . 6287
The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 6288
The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 6289
It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 6290
The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack . 6291
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 6292
Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 . 6293
Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a 6294
A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level . 6295
A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 6296
Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more . 6297
A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 6298

A film with a great premise but only a great premise . 6300
Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 6301
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . 6302

A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 6304
What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 6305
-LRB- Sam 's -RRB- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 6306

Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn . 6308
The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 6309
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 6310
Too silly to take seriously . 6311

I like it . 6314
No , I hate it . 6315
No , I love it ... hell , I dunno . 6316
This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 6317
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 6318
A fifty car pileup of cliches . 6319
It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . 6320
Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 6321
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 6322
As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player . 6323
As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired . 6324
A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 6325
It 's not hateful . 6326
It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 6327
Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 6328

A rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 6330

They were right . 6340
It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 6341
Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 6342
Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 6343
Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 6344
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 6345
Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 6346
Too ordinary to restore -LRB- Harmon -RRB- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 6347
Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind . 6348
The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 6349
It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 6350
Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 6351
It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . 6352
It still feels like a prison stretch . 6353
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 6354
Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism . 6355
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . '' 6356
Just a Kiss is a just a waste . 6357
... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 6358
Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women . 6359
And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 6360
As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 6361
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame . 6362
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 6363
It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades . 6364
There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 6365
The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works . 6366
As happily glib and vicious as its characters . 6367
One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 6368

I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 6371
Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 6372
Kurys never shows why , of all the period 's volatile romantic lives , Sand and Musset are worth particular attention . 6373

The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . ' 6378
Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . 6379
If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack . 6380
If I want a real movie , I 'll buy the Criterion DVD . 6381
An unremarkable , modern action\/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 6382
Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 6383
Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . ' 6384
Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 6385
The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 6386
An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 6387
The name says it all . 6388
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set . 6389

... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 6392
With Zoe Clarke-Williams 's lackluster thriller `` New Best Friend '' , who needs enemies ? 6393
Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 6394
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 6395
An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 6396
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian ' 6397
A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 6398
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged . 6399

I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 6404
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 6405
The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ... 6406

Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 6414
A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 6415
The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland JoffÃ© and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter . 6416
The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 6417
As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . 6418

A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 6426
I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 6427
A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 6428
Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 6429

Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script . 6432
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 6433

Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 6436
Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 6437
As plain and pedestrian as catsup -- 6438
An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it . 6439

The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 6445
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . 6446
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 6447
Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime . 6448
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 6449
All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling . 6450

The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ... 6452
For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian . 6453

Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would . 6609

While the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 6621

This thing is just garbage . 6651
As crimes go , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's How to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog is slight but unendurable . 6652
There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 6653
A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 6654

Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies . 6671

I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year . 6674
Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 6675
meanders between its powerful moments . 6676
What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip . 6677
A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 6678

It 's got the brawn , but not the brains . 6682
Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 6683
A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 6684

-LRB- T -RRB- oo many of these gross out scenes ... 6686

Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 6688
Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 6689
If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism 6690
One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 6691
The big ending surprise almost saves the movie . 6692
It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling . 6693
Charming , if overly complicated ... 6694
Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression . 6695
All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 6696
It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ... 6697
Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't . 6698
Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 6699
For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown . 6700
Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 6701
Smothered by its own solemnity . 6702
` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . ' 6703

Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 6709

If only Merchant paid more attention the story . 6711
At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 6712
... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 6713
A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 6714
The characters are based on stock clichÃ©s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 6715
Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 6716

A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 6718
Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 6719
The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 6720

plays like some corny television production from a bygone era 6722
The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 6723
For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie . 6724
I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 6725

Naipaul fans may be disappointed . 6728
Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 6729

If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother . 6732
Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . 6733
By that measure , it is a failure . 6734
A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 6735
An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality . 6736
Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't . 6737
Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . 6738
The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 6739
Has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 6740
An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson . 6741
The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 6742
Everyone 's to blame here . 6743
You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 6744
Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 6745
Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 6746
It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 6747
A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 6748
Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . 6749
But what is missing from it all is a moral . 6750
What is the filmmakers ' point ? 6751
Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 6752
You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . 6753
You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 6754
Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating . 6755
The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 6756
Formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 6757
Draggin ' about dragons 6758
Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject . 6759
A respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 6760
Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 6761
The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 6762
Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 6763
Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen . 6764
`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 6765
You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible . 6766
Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 6767
Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 6768
First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 6769
... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 6770
Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 6771
Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 6772
In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little . 6773
Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned . 6774
Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 6775
The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 6776
Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . 6777
But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 6778
In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 6779
This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 6780
The film is flat . 6781
The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable . 6782
It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 6783
An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 6784
The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough . 6785
Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ? 6786
This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 6787
The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 6788
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails . 6789
It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary . 6790
The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 6791
Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 6792
Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 6793
An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 6794

This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 6796
It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies . 6797
Oh , and Booty Call . 6798
Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches . 6799
It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 6800
Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 6801
Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 6802
A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . ' 6803
The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 6804
A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 6805
At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 6806
Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable 6807
Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work . 6808

Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ... 6810
An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 6811
Not once does it come close to being exciting . 6812
A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well . 6813
It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 6814
There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American . 6815
And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser . 6816
One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 6817
Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 6818
The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 6819
It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 6820
I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 6821
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 6822
So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 6823
The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 6824
Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 6825
It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style . 6826
Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't . 6827
A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 6828
For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer . 6829
If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us . 6830
Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 6831
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 6832
Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 6833
This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic . 6834
The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 6835
A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 6836
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 6837
Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 6838
We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 6839
Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . 6840
Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 6841
A fascinating but choppy documentary . 6842
Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 6843
The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . 6844
And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 6845
Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 6846
Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 6847
The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 6848

This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 6879

Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it . 6920

As social exposÃ© , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on . 6958

Horrible . 7013
The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do . 7014
Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon . 7015

It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 7066

If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away . 7115
Otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 7116
This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 7117
The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 7118
Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 7119
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 7120

After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 7132

One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 9111
Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ? 9112
A selection of scenes in search of a movie . 9113
-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 9114
Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 9115
True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 9116
-LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 9117
The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 9118
You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story . 9119
Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention . 9120
A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 9121
Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin . 9122
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 9123
Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 9124
Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 9125
The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine . 9126
While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances . 9127
Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 9128
A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 9129
A Lifetime movie about men . 9130
The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 9131
It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ? 9132
It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death 9133
This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable . 9134
The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 9135
I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . ' 9136
If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 9137
This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet . 9138
Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 9139
I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art . 9140
This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! ' 9141
than ` Magnifique ' . 9142
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 9143
Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear . 9144
But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary . 9145
Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon . 9146
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 9147
Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ? 9148
is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 9149
Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 9150
This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . 9151
Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep . 9152
Who is this movie for ? 9153
Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance . 9154
It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . ' 9155
A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 9156
It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary . 9157
Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . '' 9158
The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 9159
It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 9160
Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 9161
Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 9162
For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 9163
A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 9164
Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 9165
Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 9166
Originality is sorely lacking . 9167
The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story . 9168
But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 9169
Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation . 9170
Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 9171
Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert . 9172
For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . ' 9173
There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 9174
Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 9175
I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's . 9176
It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk . 9177
-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be . 9178
Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 9179
Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 9180
` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates . 9181
Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 9182
Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 9183
The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down . 9184
It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 9185
This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 9186
Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 9187
Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 9188
Every note rings false . 9189
When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 9190
It never rises to its clever what-if concept . 9191
Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 9192
This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 9193
This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People . 9194
The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . 9195
About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 9196
A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 9197
-LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment . 9198
The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious . 9199
It 's too bad nothing else is . 9200
Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 9201
El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors . 9202
Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen 9203
A serious movie with serious ideas . 9204
But seriously , folks , it does n't work . 9205
There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right . 9206
The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 9207
I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 9208
What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 9209
-LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ... 9210
Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD . 9211
The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 9212
It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 9213
I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment . 9214
The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 9215
The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 9216
Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential . 9217
There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 9218
It drowns in sap . 9219
Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 9220
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious . 9221
I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . 9222
There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 9223
The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list . 9224
The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 9225
Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative . 9226
It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 9227
Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 9228
Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel . 9229
Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 9230
The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense . 9231
With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichÃ©s . 9232
Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values . 9233
Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 9234
A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 9235
The material and the production itself are little more than routine . 9236
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 9237
Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 9238
It 's all surface psychodramatics . 9239
The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 9240
That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout . 9241
Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 9242
For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 9243
Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 9244
Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 9245
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 9246
too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 9247
There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 9248
A wordy wisp of a comedy . 9249
Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 9250
-LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie . 9251
Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes . 9252
A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 9253
Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves . 9254
A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 9255
The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 9256
Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it . 9257
I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 9258
It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire . 9259
Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen . 9260
SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 9261
After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 9262
Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight . 9263
It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 9264
If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 9265
Suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 9266
There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door . 9267
The same should go for movie theaters . 9268
Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore . 9269
The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 9270
As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs . 9271
This franchise has not spawned a single good film . 9272
The crap continues . 9273
Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- . 9274
High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 9275
Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 9276
One big blustery movie where nothing really happens . 9277
When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia . 9278
Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 9279
The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 9280
Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 9281
As it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 9282
I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay . 9283
The picture does n't know it 's a comedy . 9284
A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 9285
The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 9286
Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 9287
Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 9288
Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for -LRB- and misses -RRB- . 9289
This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned . 9290
Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 9291
Much like Robin Williams , Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 9292
An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 9293
A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with . 9294
An often unfunny romp . 9295
A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special . 9296
Twenty years later , Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 9297
Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 9298
We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 9299
Despite Hoffman 's best efforts , Wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 9300
There 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side . 9301
The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 9302
Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 9303
Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 9304
While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 9305
The origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . 9306
It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 9307
Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder . 9308
Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 9309
The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 9310
Lacks dramatic punch and depth . 9311
There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman 's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary but not enough to sustain the film . 9312
I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down . 9313
Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . ' 9314
Make like the title and dodge this one . 9315
This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 9316
The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 9317
Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 9318
It 's obvious -LRB- Je-Gyu is -RRB- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 9319
Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 9320
-LRB- Green is -RRB- the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 9321
No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story . 9322
A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . ' 9323
Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 9324
Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 9325
Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star . 9326
It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective . 9327
It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 9328
A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- . 9329
An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 9330
The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 9331
Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 9332
Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House . 9333
Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 9334
This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 9335
Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns . 9336
Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . 9337
It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy . 9338
will be far more interesting to the Soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts ... 9339
Authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 9340
Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible 9341
Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 9342
The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 9343
The screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as Hip-Hop Scooby-Doo . 9344
Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ... 9345
Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much . 9346
... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 9347
A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 9348
Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 9349
Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 9350
The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 9351
A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 9352
Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . 9353
It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 9354
A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 9355
... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 9356
Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 9357
As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising . 9358
Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , Caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 9359
To work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . 9360
That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 9361
Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 9362
A puzzle whose pieces do not fit . 9363
Some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 9364
Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 9365
The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 9366
` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 9367
Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 9368
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . 9369
In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable 9370
An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn . 9371
A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 9372
So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style . 9373
A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective . 9374
`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 9375
Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 9376
Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 9377
Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork . 9378
entertaining enough , but nothing new 9379
... one resurrection too many . 9380
This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . 9381
Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 9382
DeMeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 9383
In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 9384
No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised . 9385

It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 9656
A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 9657
It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 9658
Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 9659
It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors . 9660
This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 9661
A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series . 9662
Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series . 9663
Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 9664
As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 9665
Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes . 9666
Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 9667
More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 9668
The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 9669
Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 9670
Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market . 9671
Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 9672
It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 9673
On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 9674
The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder . 9675
... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 9676
Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 9677
Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? ' 9678
scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens . 9679
Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose . 9680
Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 9681
The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 9682
A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 9683
It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 9684
-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 9685
Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 9686
So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 9687
Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 9688
Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features . 9689
Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 9690
Very stupid and annoying . 9691
The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia . 9692
A listless and desultory affair . 9693
Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 9694
How inept is Serving Sara ? 9695
It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly . 9696
Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . 9697
Every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 9698
Wins my vote for ` The 2002 Enemy of Cinema ' Award . 9699
Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 9700
Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 9701
Lazy , miserable and smug . 9702
This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 9703
Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 9704
Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . 9705
There 's no energy . 9706
Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 9707
After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 9708
This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them ! 9709
At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 9710
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 9711
A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss . 9712
The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 9713
If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 9714
This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . ' 9715
Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 9716
Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up . 9717
There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 9718
It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 9719
All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 9720
A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there . 9721
Good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 9722
The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 9723
Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 9724
At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . 9725
Your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . 9726
Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow . 9727
Elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . 9728
If you 're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly , watch Snatch again . 9729
It 's 51 times better than this . 9730
It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 9731
Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ' 9732
Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 9733
Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 9734
Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 9735
Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . 9736
There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 9737
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 9738
There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title . 9739
While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 9740
A preposterous , prurient whodunit . 9741
Go , girls , right down the reality drain . 9742
Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 9743
Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 9744
Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 9745
... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 9746
The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 9747
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 9748
Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner . 9749
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash . 9750
Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny . 9751
` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy . 9752
At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III . 9753
It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 9754
Wanker Goths are on the loose ! 9755
Run for your lives ! 9756
Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 9757
A grating , emaciated flick . 9758
Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 9759
Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 9760
We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 9761
According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other . 9762
But you 'd never guess that from the performances . 9763
The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 9764
Ararat feels like a book report 9765
Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen . 9766
A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 9767
An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension . 9768
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 9769
Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about 9770
With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp . 9771
Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 9772
The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 9773
This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 9774
The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring . 9775
Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichÃ© . 9776
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale 9777
Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry . 9778
Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 9779
The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 9780
Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' . 9781
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . 9782
If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 9783
With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 9784
Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot . 9785
A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about . 9786
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . ' 9787
This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 9788
The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 9789
De Niro cries . 9790
You 'll cry for your money back . 9791
Slap me , I saw this movie . 9792
-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 9793
Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting . 9794
Quelle surprise ! 9795
Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle . 9796
Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 9797
Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material 9798
The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era . 9799
They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 9800
Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . ' 9801
So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 9802
In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 9803
Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichÃ©s . 9804
Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates . 9805
One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 9806
There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 9807
` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 9808
The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 9809
Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings . 9810
In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year . 9811
Five screenwriters are credited with the clichÃ©-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 9812
The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break . 9813
Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 9814
So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat . 9815
The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster . 9816
Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 9817
` Snow Dogs ' has both . 9818
It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 9819
Wobbly Senegalese updating of `` Carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai 9820
It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long . 9821
Ken Russell would love this . 9822
In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes . 9823
Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . 9824
This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 9825
The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess . 9826
What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 9827
A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films . 9828
Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression . 9829
The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects . 9830
The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it . 9831
The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role . 9832
The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 9833
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 9834
The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film . 9835
Opera on film is never satisfactory . 9836
The art demands live viewing . 9837
The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 9838
Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 9839
It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 9840
The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste . 9841
It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 9842
Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 9843
As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 9844
Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 9845
A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures . 9846
Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 9847
Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 9848
A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 9849
The story has little wit and no surprises . 9850
The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 9851
What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety . 9852
Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? 9853
I did n't think so . 9854
A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 9855
-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 9856
The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 9857
... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . 9858
This Scarlet 's letter is A. . . 9859
as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 9860
Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 9861
The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest . 9862
A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 9863
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 9864
Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 9865
A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 9866
There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film . 9867
It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more . 9868
The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself . 9869
She 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life . 9870
A quaint , romanticized rendering . 9871
What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song . 9872
The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 9873
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 9874
Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending . 9875
Now he makes them . 9876
She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ... 9877
Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 9878
Been there done that . 9879
There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew . 9880
A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 9881
Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 9882
Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 9883
Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 9884
A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 9885
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . 9886
We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art . 9887
It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up . 9888
Bravado Kathy ! 9889
... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . 9890
Too bad . 9891
You can thank me for this . 9892
I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to . 9893
Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 9894
Basically , it 's pretty but dumb . 9895
This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 9896
Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 9897
There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings . 9898
Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . 9899
It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down . 9900
The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 9901
Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 9902
If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 9903
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 9904
If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way . 9905
Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard . 9906
What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour . 9907
Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 9908
An uninspired preachy and clichÃ©d war film . 9909
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible . 9910
A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people . 9911
Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 9912
If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 9913
The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 9914
I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered . 9915
Little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 9916
Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 9917
A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 9918
The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 9919
The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 9920
Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 9921
It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mÃ©tier . 9922
How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 9923
When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W. 9924
There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 9925
The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 9926
It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 9927
The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 9928
Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 9929
The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 9930
Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 9931
-LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 9932
It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 9933
Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price . 9934
If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 9935

The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 9937
It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 9938
Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 9939
It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . 9940
Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does . 9941
Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 9942
Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 9943
Something must have been lost in the translation . 9944
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring . 9945

Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 9947
Rock 's stand-up magic wanes . 9948
Hopkins , squarely fills the screen . 9949
Action - mechanical . 9950

Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes . 9952
For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming . 9953
The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 9954
What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie . 9955
Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King . 9956
City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . 9957
But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery . 9958
Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes . 9959

There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious . 9961
I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 9962
What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate . 9963
Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films . 9964
The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 9965
Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 9966
Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic . 9967
Amid the clichÃ© and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn . 9968

No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild . 9970
Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good . 9971
Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression . 9972
There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 9973
It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's . 9974
There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups . 9975
We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 9976
Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 9977
There is nothing redeeming about this movie . 9978
The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between . 9979
I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care . 9980
Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 9981
Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 9982
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 9983
Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 9984
A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 9985
To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 9986
Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 9987
Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up . 9988
ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 9989
How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? 9990
In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- . 9991
Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try . 9992
Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 9993
The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny . 9994
-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 9995
Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 9996
Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet . 9997
Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 9998
The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . ' 9999
Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . ' 10000
In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 10001
It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about . 10002
So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals . 10003
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades 10004
The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 10005
Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 10006
There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 10007
A cockeyed shot all the way . 10008
Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 10009
Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title . 10010
Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 10011
Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth . 10012
The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 10013
Seems like someone going through the motions . 10014
For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film . 10015
Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 10016
Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 10017
Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 10018
Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 10019
Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . ' 10020
One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 10021
A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 10022
It 's a fanboy ` what if ? ' 10023
brought to life on the big screen . 10024
The story itself is actually quite vapid . 10025
It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s . 10026
Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand . 10027
A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic . 10028
Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 10029
Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement . 10030
Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 10031
One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 10032
Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 10033
Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 10034
It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge . 10035
That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 10036
What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 10037
The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting . 10038
In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 10039
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke 10040
Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* . 10041

Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered . 10043
A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 10044
Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 10045
It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 10046
For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 10047
A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 10048
A faster paced family flick . 10049
Upper Teens may get cynical . 10050
Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 10051
While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 10052
It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 10053
Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 10054
It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 10055
`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father . 10056
The movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 10057
It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 10058
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake . 10059
By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 10060
For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable . 10061
It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs . 10062
made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day . 10063
But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 10064
If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good . 10065
But it was n't . 10066
For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 10067
... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school . 10068
It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 10069
The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain . 10070
A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 10071
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic . 10072
It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has . 10073
With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 10074
Does n't really add up to much . 10075
It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 10076
An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 10077
A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 10078
Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 10079
It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 10080
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . ' 10081
The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 10082
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 10083
It 's like a drive-by . 10084
You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 10085
Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 10086
This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie . 10087
Stress ` dumb . ' 10088
The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 10089
When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ? 10090
It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 10091
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? ' 10092
A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 10093
Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 10094
There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale . 10095
As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 10096
The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name . 10097
Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 10098
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story . 10099
Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party . 10100
When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . ' 10101
Just is n't as weird as it ought to be . 10102
A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 10103
-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie . 10104
No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 10105
` Hey Arnold ! ' 10106
has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere . 10107
They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 10108
A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 10109
A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . 10110
Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 10111
It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love . 10112
The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . '' 10113
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . '' 10114
Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichÃ©s . 10115
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 10116
Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 10117
The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental . 10118
A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 10119
Falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 10120
Never inspires more than an interested detachment . 10121
What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 10122
Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 10123
Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 10124
They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 10125
A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . 10126
It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 10127
Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 10128
It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 10129
These are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 10130
Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 10131
Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 10132
Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 10133
Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 10134
Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 10135
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 10136
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 10137
One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album . 10138
Phoned-in business as usual . 10139
There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 10140
What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 10141
Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 10142
Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 10143
The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . '' 10144
It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . '' 10145
It 's that painful . 10146
God is great , the movie 's not . 10147
Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 10148
When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . 10149
Or else a doggie winks . 10150
A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 10151
As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music . 10152
Plays like John Le CarrÃ© with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 10153
You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 10154
It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments . 10155
Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 10156
A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie . 10157
-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 10158
Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 10159
The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it 10160
Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 10161
It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 10162
Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 10163
I did n't find much fascination in the swinging . 10164
What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . 10165
But that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 10166
The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 10167
After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clichÃ© has been unturned . 10168
But no. . 10169
Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok . 10170
Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them . 10171
Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination . 10172
It was a dark and stormy night ... 10173
A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 10174
This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows . 10175
Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 10176
Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher . 10177
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 10178
Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful . 10179
Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 10180
What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 10181
Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 10182
Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory . 10183
Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown . 10184
The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 10185
Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ? 10186
is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 10187
While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 10188
Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 10189
Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 10190
Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier . 10191
It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 10192
Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 10193
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 10194
Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 10195
High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd . 10196
Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York . 10197
The chocolate factory without Charlie . 10198
Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 10199
Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 10200
A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 10201
Deserving of its critical backlash and more . 10202
Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . 10203
Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 10204
The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- . 10205
The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his . 10206
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 10207
It recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 10208
I 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 10209
May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 10210
Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice . 10211
It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 10212
Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 10213
If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake . 10214
Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet . 10215
Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 10216
Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 10217
All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness . 10218
The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance . 10219
... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 10220
The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess . 10221
No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 10222
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 10223
Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 10224
The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . ' 10225
Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me . 10226
More tiring than anything . 10227
Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . 10228
It 's horribly depressing and not very well done . 10229
... the efforts of its star , Kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 10230
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 10231
Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? 10232
And it 's a lousy one at that . 10233
Overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 10234
I 'll go out on a limb . 10235
It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year . 10236
It 's just merely very bad . 10237
Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 10238
About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men . 10239
Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 10240
Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 10241
In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works . 10242
The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 10243
Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 10244
Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 10245
A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 10246
A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? ' 10247
Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 10248
Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 10249
If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it . 10250
An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 10251
What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 10252
The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot . 10253
This pathetic junk is barely an hour long . 10254
Nevertheless , it still seems endless . 10255
It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure ! 10256
It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good . 10257
And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch . 10258
Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 10259
Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 10260
It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman . 10261
The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material . 10262
Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 10263
Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 10264
Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 10265
Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 10266
Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 10267
The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project . 10268
displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver 10269
So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 10270
An awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work . 10271
The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen . 10272
Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 10273
Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous . 10274
Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 10275
It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name . 10276
Rosenthal -LRB- Halloween II -RRB- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 10277
Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort . 10278
Rodriguez ... was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 10279
A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 10280
Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 10281
This is n't a terrible film by any means , but it 's also far from being a realized work . 10282
Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program . 10283
Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . 10284
Only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 10285
A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity . 10286
Not bad , but not all that good . 10287
Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price . 10288
What 's next ? 10289
Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ? 10290
David Spade as Citizen Kane ? 10291
Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center . 10292
The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 10293
It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be . 10294
Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 10295
On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture . 10296
I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 10297
It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 10298
After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 10299
We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 10300
Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 10301
The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 10302
Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns What Time Is It There ? 10303
into How Long Is This Movie ? 10304
Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 10305
Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 10306
It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 10307
Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star . 10308
It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 10309
A dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 10310
An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 10311
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh . 10312
This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one . 10313
These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 10314
The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it . 10315
Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold . 10316
The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold . 10317
... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids . 10318
A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 10319
The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 10320
Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 10321
A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 10322
... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc . 10323
Reyes ' word processor . 10324
Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour . 10325
It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison . 10326
A little objectivity could have gone a long way . 10327
One of the worst films of 2002 . 10328
I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them . 10329
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood . 10330
McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 10331
High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 10332
This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States . 10333
The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 10334
This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 10335
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 10336
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 10337
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 10338
The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 10339
I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 10340
The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other . 10341
The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA . 10342
Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 10343
After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 10344
` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... ' 10345
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy . 10346
Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 10347
If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material . 10348
It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 10349
Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 10350
The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . '' 10351
A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 10352
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 10353
Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this . 10354
-LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers . 10355
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 10356
If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles . 10357
Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 10358
Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 10359
Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 10360
It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion . 10361
Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 10362
The camera whirls ! 10363
The camera twirls ! 10364
Oh , look at that clever angle ! 10365
Wow , a jump cut ! 10366
Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 10367
The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up . 10368
It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 10369
It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 10370
Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing . 10371
Far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 10372
-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 10373
Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 10374
A ragbag of cliches . 10375
This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now . 10376
The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 10377
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 10378
This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story . 10379
Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 10380
Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure . 10381
What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ? 10382
Collateral Damage offers formula payback and the Big Payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 10383
The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflÃ© gone wrong . 10384
Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 10385
You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ? 10386
Just send it to Cranky . 10387
We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 10388
An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 10389
The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad . 10390
The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal . 10391
The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 10392
No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 10393
Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser . 10394
One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . 10395
Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever . 10396
Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 10397
Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 10398
We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . 10399
Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire . 10400
There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 10401
` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? ' 10402
The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments . 10403
Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 10404
This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 10405
The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again . 10406
Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 10407
Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 10408
Every joke is repeated at least four times . 10409
Every joke is repeated at least four times . 10410
Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ? 10411
Comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 10412
The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 10413
Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess . 10414
-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 10415
The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 10416
Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 10417
A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 10418
Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . 10419
They cheapen the overall effect . 10420
Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital . 10421
An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism . 10422
-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 10423
An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 10424
Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 10425
The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 10426
Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen . 10427
The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters . 10428
Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 10429
The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 10430
More a gunfest than a Rock concert . 10431
It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni . 10432
A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . 10433
It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 10434
It 's not original enough . 10435
A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 10436
Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games . 10437
A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive . 10438
Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent . 10439
An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' . 10440
The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . . 10441
Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 10442
So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy . 10443
I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD . 10444
For free . 10445
I still want my money back . 10446
It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting . 10447
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 10448
All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 . 10449
... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick . 10450
Strictly middle of the road . 10451
Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 10452
After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music . 10453
No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive . 10454
A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 10455
With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 10456
`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 10457
A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 10458
Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy . 10459
Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors . 10460
Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 10461
Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel . 10462
A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 10463
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- . 10464
Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 10465
Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock . 10466
Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 10467
How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- FranÃ§ois and MichÃ¨le 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 10468
They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 10469
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 10470
The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy . 10471
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 10472
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 10473
The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 10474
Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 10475
Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . 10476
Enigma lacks it . 10477
Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 10478
... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 10479
A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 10480
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 10481
In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 10482
Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pÃ¨re-fils confrontations . 10483
McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 10484
Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 10485
New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ... 10486
Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 10487
Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling . 10488
A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 10489
A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 10490
Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . 10491
But , no , we get another scene , and then another . 10492
You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 10493
An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 10494
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 10495
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 10496
Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 10497
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 10498
Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 10499
Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 10500
The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 10501
For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ? 10502
lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 10503
Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up . 10504
But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail . 10505
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money . 10506
It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 10507
Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 10508
For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence . 10509
There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 10510
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 10511
It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 10512
I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . 10513
I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't . 10514
Dreary tale of middle-class angst 10515
For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 10516
-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 10517
Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else . 10518
Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 10519
An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 10520
-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 10521
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 10522
Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite . 10523
Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 10524
A decidedly mixed bag . 10525
There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 10526
Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin . 10527
Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 10528
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 10529
Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 10530
Just dreadful . 10531
I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 10532
Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films . 10533
hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 10534
This is just lazy writing . 10535
Even kids deserve better . 10536
The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . 10537
And Diesel is n't the actor to save it . 10538
Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 10539
... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet . 10540
Frank Capra played this story straight . 10541
But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes . 10542
How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 10543
The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 10544
Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . 10545
Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflÃ© . 10546
`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 10547
A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder 10548
Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 10549
It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles . 10550
An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original . 10551
Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 10552
Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire . 10553
Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 10554
Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 10555
All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 10556
This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 10557
I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . 10558
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 10559
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better . 10560
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 10561
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 10562
Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 10563
Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 10564
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens . 10565
The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 10566
` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . ' 10567

The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls . 10569
While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation . 10570
A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics . 10571
What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ? 10572
Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal . 10573

The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions . 10575
What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel . 10576
Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 10577
With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 10578
It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 10579
Loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 10580
Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning . 10581
You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 10582
A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 10583
Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 10584
Seriously , rent the Disney version . 10585
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 10586
Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest . 10587
It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to . 10588
`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 10589
Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 10590
A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 10591
A loquacious and dreary piece of business . 10592
What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -LRB- dark green , to be exact -RRB- , sour , bloody and mean . 10593
director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention 10594
Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 10595
Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 10596
Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 10597
I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 10598
While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration . 10599
I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen . 10600
The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 10601
Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 10602
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 10603
The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 10604
If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear . 10605
This is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 10606
A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan . 10607
He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan 's Privates . 10608
But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either . 10609
May puzzle his most ardent fans . 10610
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 10611
We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 10612
Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering . 10613
Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose Madonna . 10614
The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 10615
Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 10616
While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . '' 10617
The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . ' 10618
... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . ' 10619
More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 10620
TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 10621
-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 10622
If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 10623
It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows . 10624
Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap . 10625
Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 10626
Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 10627
This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 10628
Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 10629
Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . 10630
Vulgar is too optimistic a title . 10631
The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . 10632
The characters never change . 10633
If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 10634
Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst . 10635

A bad movie that happened to good actors . 10638
Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 10639
Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 10640
Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 10641
That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies . 10642
It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 10643
Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning . 10644
If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 10645
The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 10646
The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting . 10647
Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 10648
Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 10649
In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 10650
-LRB- T -RRB- he ideas of Revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution 10651
The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side . 10652
What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 10653
Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire . 10654
Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 10655
Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 10656
Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 10657
Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 10658
All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 10659
-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original . 10660
One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 10661
For dance completists only . 10662
Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations 10663
It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 10664
The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 10665
Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo . 10666
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere . 10667
This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation . 10668
Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 10669
Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 10670

The title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 10673
Low comedy does n't come much lower . 10674
Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites . 10675
It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins . 10676
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once . 10677
This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 10678
Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears . 10679
A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 10680
An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 . 10681
The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 10682
The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 10683
Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 10684
A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 10685
I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 10686
... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 10687
Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 10688
One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before . 10689
Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 10690
The film 's most improbable feat ? 10691
It did n't go straight to video . 10692
... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 10693
The Chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 10694
Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 10695
It 's not too fast and not too slow . 10696
It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive . 10697
It 's not too much of anything . 10698
The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home . 10699
About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 10700
An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 10701
We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 10702
Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics . 10703
Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable . 10704
Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't . 10705

Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine . 10707
Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 10708

Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 10710
The entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 10711
I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 10712
The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 10713
A Movie to Forget 10714
For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2Â 1\/2 - hour running time . 10715
Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . 10716
The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 10717
It looks good , but it is essentially empty . 10718
The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 10719
The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run . 10720
Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 10721
It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 10722
Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 10723
The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 10724
Tennessee Williams by way of Oprah 's Book Club . 10725
So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie . 10726
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 10727
Stale and clichÃ©d to a fault . 10728
This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 10729
Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 10730
The script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for Spy Kids . 10731
Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 10732
Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 10733
Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart . 10734
Witless and utterly pointless . 10735
When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 10736

The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! 10864
-- was a fad that had long since vanished . 10865

An empty , purposeless exercise . 10908
Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 10909

The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made . 10928
Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability . 10929
A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC . 10930

A thriller without a lot of thrills . 11001
This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 11002
Ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! 11003
Alas , another breathless movie about same ! 11004
In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 11005
Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious . 11006
Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment . 11007
Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 11008
Slap her - she 's not funny ! 11009
No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 11010
Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 11011
`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? '' 11012
Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ? 11013
`` Not really as bad as you might think ! '' 11014
Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing . 11015
One regards Reign of Fire with awe . 11016
What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 11017
It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 11018
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy . 11019
Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one . 11020
The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 11021
I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD . 11022
An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 11023
Ninety minutes of Viva Castro ! 11024
can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included 11025
Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 11026
It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 11027
In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . 11028
... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . '' 11029
Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 11030
Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- . 11031
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 11032
None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . 11033
The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective . 11034
A great script brought down by lousy direction . 11035
Same guy with both hats . 11036
Big mistake . 11037
A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke . 11038
Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks . 11039
He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash . 11040
In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 11041
The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 11042
Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going . 11043
According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 11044
An encouraging effort from McCrudden 11045
The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 11046
If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it . 11047
Fortunately , you still have that option . 11048
Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 11049
Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 11050
To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ... 11051
A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 11052
This u-boat does n't have a captain . 11053
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 11054
This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 11055
Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 11056
I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like . 11057
Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care . 11058
After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget . 11059
A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 11060
The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . 11061
But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences 11062
Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio . 11063
As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all . 11064
... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already . 11065
Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets . 11066
It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 11067
The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 11068
The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . ' 11069
But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 11070
Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 11071
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . 11072
What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 11073
A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . . 11074
little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 11075
The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 11076
The Master of Disguise is awful . 11077
It 's Pauly Shore awful . 11078
Do n't say you were n't warned . 11079
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter . 11080
The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 11081
` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down . 11082
What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 11083
An ugly , revolting movie . 11084
The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way . 11085
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it . 11086
Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale . 11087
You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 11088
Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 11089
It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 11090
The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ? 11091
From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten 11092
My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 11093
A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 11094
Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 11095
directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name 11096
The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 11097
An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 11098
Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 11099
Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 11100
Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . 11101
Alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 11102
While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 11103
The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 11104
Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 11105
Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character . 11106
Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 11107
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone . 11108
Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 11109
Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional . 11110
The film is all over the place , really . 11111
It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 11112
The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 11113
The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 11114
Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 11115
When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 11116
Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 11117
Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 11118
While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter 11119
Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 11120
Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks . 11121
It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . 11122
And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 11123
The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul . 11124
The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much . 11125
Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 11126
The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm . 11127
Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair . 11128
The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . 11129
It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 11130
All mood and no movie . 11131
Press the delete key . 11132
Simone is not a bad film . 11133
It just does n't have anything really interesting to say . 11134
Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 11135
... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around . 11136
Wait to see it then . 11137
There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . 11138
Or for the year , for that matter . 11139
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 11140
This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 11141
Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke . 11142
Over and over again . 11143
The threat implied in the title PokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 11144
The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 11145
To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 11146
Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were . 11147
The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 11148
By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them . 11149
Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . 11150
It 's not an easy one to review . 11151
At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . 11152
But it would be better to wait for the video . 11153
And a very rainy day . 11154
The whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 11155
Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 11156
Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ? 11157
Um , no. . 11158
But here 's a movie about it anyway . 11159
Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 11160
The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . 11161
But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 11162
Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 11163
Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . 11164
Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . 11165
But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro . 11166
A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 11167
Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured . 11168
Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 11169
It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 11170
Woody , what happened ? 11171
Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 11172
It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah . 11173
You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell . 11174
Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ? 11175
Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 11176
Routine and rather silly . 11177
A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat . 11178
Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time . 11179
You can practically hear George Orwell turning over . 11180
Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 11181
While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 11182
Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling . 11183
If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo . 11184
If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J. 11185
A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 11186
How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? 11187
On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 11188
The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting . 11189
More trifle than triumph . 11190
The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 11191
Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 11192
Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 11193
It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out . 11194
Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 11195
Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement . 11196
Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- . 11197
The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 11198
As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' . 11199
Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 11200
... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags . 11201
Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 11202
A well-acted , but one-note film . 11203
Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period . 11204
The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 11205
-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . 11206
And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 11207
There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 11208
No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 11209
It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 11210
Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 11211
The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 11212
Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 11213
Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay . 11214
The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 11215
We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine . 11216
Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash . 11217
More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 11218
Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be . 11219
When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 11220
This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 11221
Marinated in clichÃ©s and mawkish dialogue . 11222
Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears . 11223
But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 11224
-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 11225
Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . ' 11226
Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 11227
The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it . 11228
We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 11229
Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . 11230
It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 11231
Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 11232
Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 11233
Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 11234
Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 11235
With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard . 11236
Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? 11237
When the twist endings were actually surprising ? 11238
When the violence actually shocked ? 11239
When the heroes were actually under 40 ? 11240
Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 11241
Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 11242
This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 . 11243
What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie . 11244
In other words , it 's badder than bad . 11245
If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn . 11246
A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken . 11247
A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis . 11248
Where the film falters is in its tone . 11249
The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 11250
Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 11251
It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 11252
Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 11253
Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . 11254
Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic . 11255
An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving . 11256
A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 11257
A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 11258
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 11259
Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum . 11260
Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either . 11261
Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 11262
The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 11263
It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichÃ©s the filmmakers could dredge up . 11264
Nothing but an episode of Smackdown ! 11265
in period costume and with a bigger budget . 11266
It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned . 11267
While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 11268
It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 11269
A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 11270
A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 11271
If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clichÃ© . 11272
Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 11273
This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 11274
Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 11275
` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 11276
The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 11277

Hate it because it 's lousy . 11282
... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 11283
Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create . 11284
The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either . 11285
Competently directed but terminally cute drama . 11286
The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 11287
Not just unlikable . 11288
Disturbing . 11289

Without any redeeming value whatsoever . 11291

In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 11298
Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 11299
The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 11300
The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 11301
A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 11302
The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 11303
Spy-vs . 11304

A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie . 11306
The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits . 11307
Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around . 11308
An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 11309
A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust . 11310
This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often . 11311
This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 11312
Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 11313
The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 11314
Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me . 11315
A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 . 11316
Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' . 11317
Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line . 11318
An extraordinarily silly thriller . 11319
A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 11320
Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 11321
Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 11322
The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 11323
The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 11324
The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 11325
Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions . 11326
What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 11327

The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau . 11330
... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 11331
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't . 11332
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 11333
The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 11334
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 11335
This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of AmÃ©lie . 11336
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue 11337

If there ai n't none , you have a problem . 11339

More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 11344
Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 11345
It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . 11346
Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 11347
A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 11348
The drama discloses almost nothing . 11349
A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard . 11350
Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating . 11351
As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 11352
A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 11353
There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . 11354
And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men . 11355
Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 11356
It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 11357
It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 11358
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese . 11359
But it does n't need Gangs of New York . 11360

Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard . 11364
-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 11365
One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen . 11366
Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 11367

The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 11374

We do n't even like their characters . 11387

The movie does n't generate a lot of energy . 11389
It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 11390
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head 11391
Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 11392

Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 11407
an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? '' 11408
- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 11409
A feeble Tootsie knockoff . 11410
An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 11411

The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 11413

Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality 11417
A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick . 11418
-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through . 11419

Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 11421
... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 11422

Nothing about them is attractive . 11426
What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 11427
Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 11428
A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 11429
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 11430
It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 11431
Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying . 11432
Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring . 11433

` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 11437
In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 11438
Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 11439
Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda . 11440
Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . 11441
How about surprising us by trying something new ? 11442
Final verdict : You 've seen it all before . 11443
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material . 11444
If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . '' 11445

A full-frontal attack on audience patience . 11450

Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish . 11453

The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs . 11457
The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies . 11458
Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . 11459

The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down . 11469
You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 11470
Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 11471

We get the comedy we settle for . 11473
The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 11474
Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 11475

is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . 11485
Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing . 11486
True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 11487
Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago . 11488
The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 11489
Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 11490
The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 11491
Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on . 11492
It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush . 11493
Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 11494
... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 11495
The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 11496
Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 11497
In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 11498

You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 11500

That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . '' 11505
It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud . 11506
If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will . 11507
Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 11508

Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on 11510
As pedestrian as they come . 11511
A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 11512

Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work . 11514
More intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 11515
An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 11516

As saccharine as it is disposable . 11518

The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 11520
Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 11521
Too much power , not enough puff . 11522
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 11523
It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 11524
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 11525
Muddled , trashy and incompetent 11526
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league . 11527
Narc is all menace and atmosphere . 11528
Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 11529

his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 11532
It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 11533
A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 11534
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them . 11535
As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction . 11536
The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 11537
Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid . 11538

American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone . 11557

It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough . 11559

From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge ' 11573
