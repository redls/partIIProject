``Extreme Ops'' exceeds expectations. Good fun, good action, good acting, good dialogue, good pace, good cinematography.
A thunderous ride's at first, quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action. Still, this flick is fun, and host to some truly excellent sequences.
This movie was great.
